## Strand Orientation Bias Detector (SOBDetector) to remove artifacts from sequencing data of formalin fixed samples. 

---

by analyzing the orientation of paired end sequences that are spanning the variantsâ€™ locations.

The
most prominent of those is the deamination of cytosines, which introduces
CFT/GFA mutations (Oh et al., 2015). 


As a measure of the strand orientation, we defined the strand orientation bias
(SOB) score, as the following:
SOB = (#F1R2alt - #F2R1alt)/(#F1R2alt + #F1R2alt')
where #ofF1R2alt is the number of alternate allele supporting reads that are in the
forward 1st, reverse 2nd orientation.
SOB score lies in the [-1,1] interval, and the closer it is to the two extrema, the
higher the probability, that the corresponding variant is a sequencing artifact.
