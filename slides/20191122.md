The purpose READ_NAME_REGEX is to specify a regular expression that will 
capture from the read name the physical location of the cluster in the 
lane.  This is used to distinguish optical duplicates (cases in which 
the cluster-finding software has incorrectly identified a single cluster 
as two clusters), from PCR duplicates.  If two reads are considered 
duplicates of one another, and their physical locations are close to one 
another (as defined by OPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE), then they are 
considered optical duplicates, and excluded from the computation of 
estimated library size.

The default value for READ_NAME_REGEX is a regular expression that 
captures physical location from the conventional Illumina read name 
format.  If you read the usage for this option, you'll see that the 
regex must contain 3 capture groups, which yours does not, thus the 
exception.  It appears that your read names do not include physical 
location, so you can either leave the default value and ignore the 
warning message, or you can pass READ_NAME_REGEX=null, which will 
suppress this functionality entirely.  That seems the most appropriate 
thing to do since your reads don't contain physical location info.
