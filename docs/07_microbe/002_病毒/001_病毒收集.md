+ Viruses have higher mutation rates than cellular-based taxa, with RNA viruses having mutation rates as high as 1.5 × 10− 3 mutations per nucleotide, per genomic replication cycle [6]. 

+ Viral quasispecies
+ Viral strains often refers to different lineages of viruses found in separate hosts, or a co-infection of viruses in the same host due to multiple infection events.
