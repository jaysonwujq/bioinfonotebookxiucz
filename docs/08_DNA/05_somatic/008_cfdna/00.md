Each consensus alignment represents a set of original paired reads which share the same position and same barcode;

## 高深度检测难点
position-based deduplication (e.g. Picard MarkDuplicates [6]) with changes to address two major challenges. These challenges are
+ (1) biological duplication can not easily be distinguished from PCR duplication in regions of ultra-deep coverage
+ (2) consensus sequences that match the reference genome are typically chosen over the sequences containing variants.
