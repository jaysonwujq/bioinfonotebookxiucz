EstimatesofCNAsalsodependon:
–  Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) of CNAs 
–  Purity of the tumor samples

 1) ability to work with heterogeneous tumors, 2) high sensitivity even for comparatively short CNAs or sub-clonal events with the low CCF, 3) high specificity even
for noisy samples; 4) ability to perform allelespecific calling for the deciphering of complex
CNAs, 5) ability to work with all the types
of NGS data used for the analysis of cancer
genomes, 6) intuitive output visualization for
clinical interpretation by clinicians
