 The ploidy of cancer cells refers to the amount of DNA they contain.
 If there's a normal amount of DNA in the cells, they are said to be diploid. These cancers tend to grow and spread more slowly.
 If the amount of DNA is abnormal, then the cells are called aneuploid. These cancers tend to be more aggressive. (They tend to grow and spread faster.)
