Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms:
brunet, als, mult, sNMFR and gdclsNMF etc.
+ The result showed that brunet is worse among other algorithms in terms of reconstruction errors and stabilities. Moreover, brunet fluctuated more frequently as compared with the others. 
+ The sNMFR took the most time during the evaluation process. 
+ Herein, I would recommend users to the als algorithm with respect to its performance and time cost.
