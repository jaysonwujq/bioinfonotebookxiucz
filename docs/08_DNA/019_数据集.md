##Benchmark datasets
ICGC benchmarking exercise

```
Medulloblastoma tumour/normal pair sequenced in 6 different centres to combined 300-fold coverage used to establish 'truth'

16 ICGC project teams ran their pipelines on data from one centre (40x)

ICGC-TCGA DREAM Somatic Mutation Calling challenge

```
6 synthetic datasets based on cell line sequenced to 80x, BAM randomnly split into 2 ('tumour' and 'normal'), mutations added to one computationally

Synthetic dataset 4: 80% cellularity; 50% and 35% subclone VAF (effectively 30% and 15%)
