## Download

Use git to clone the most recent release (the source code package of GitHub does not contains required sub-modules):

    > git clone --recursive https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits.git
        > cd ngs-bits
        > git checkout 2020_12
        > git submodule update --recursive --init

### Resolving proxy issues with git

If you are behind a proxy that blocks the standard git port, you see something like this:

    > git clone --recursive https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits.git
    Cloning into 'ngs-bits'...
    fatal: Unable to look up github.com (port 9418) (Name or service not known)

Then you have to adapt your ~/.gitconfig file like that:

    [http]
    proxy = http://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]
