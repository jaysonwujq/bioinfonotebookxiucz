1. It seems odd that
2. Sorry for the naive question but I am a little bit confused with the "--required_maximum_alt_allele_mapping_quality_score" parameter. Shouldn't it be the threshold for the minimum required mapping quality ensuring that there is "at least one observation of the mutant allele" with a decent mapping quality?.. Otherwise I can't make sense out of it.
3. And one more question concerning filter parameters.
4. Was this argument discarded or renamed？


Hi Sebastian,
I really like your tool arriba, it's really fast.
But recently I encountered this weird issue, what's the possible reason for it ? is it because some GTF records ? very similar splicing junction structures ? or anything else ...
Thanks.


It's really strange and I have no real clue about what can cause that behavior.

default thresholds
The default thresholds are just an empirical compromise between speed, sensitivty, and precision.
I've run into this problem a few times now having attempted to debug the issue in various ways. 
Can you elaborate on what makes this output looks abnormal?

To get a first impression, we use a data set, in which CNVs have been artificially implanted.

Thank you for your tremendous service developing this tool.
Can you please elaborate a little bit on how enabling this parameter affects variant calling? 
Regarding this situation of multiallelic sites, I also have one question.
Thank you in advance for your help, and sorry if something is unclear -- please let me know.
