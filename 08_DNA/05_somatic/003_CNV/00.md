## 名词
### LRR
> **LRR** is a measure of normalized total signal intensity.
> **BAF** is a measure of normalized allelic intensity ratio.
```
BAF = Y / (X + Y)
LRR = log2( (X + Y)sampleOfInterest / (X+Y)baselineSample)
```
The combination of LRR and BAF can be used together to determine different copy numbers and to differentiate copy-neutral LOH regions from normal copy regions.
