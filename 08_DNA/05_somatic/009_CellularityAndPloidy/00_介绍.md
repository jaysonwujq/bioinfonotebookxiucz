## ploidy
> ploidy: the amount of DNA per tumour cell, expressed as multiples of haploid genomes.

 The ploidy of cancer cells refers to the amount of DNA they contain.
 If there's a normal amount of DNA in the cells, they are said to be diploid. These cancers tend to grow and spread more slowly.
 If the amount of DNA is abnormal, then the cells are called aneuploid. These cancers tend to be more aggressive. (They tend to grow and spread faster.)

## Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) 
Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a cross chromosomal event that results in loss of the entire gene and the surrounding chromosomal region.

The loss of heterozygosity is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumor suppressor gene in the lost region. However, many people remain healthy with such a loss, because there still is one functional gene left on the other chromosome of the chromosome pair. The remaining copy of the tumor suppressor gene can be inactivated by a point mutation, leaving no tumor suppressor gene to protect the body. Loss of heterozygosity does not imply a homozygous state (which would require the presence of two identical alleles in the cell).
